<!-- About Einstein -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>

  <p>
    Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. From an early age,
    he showed deep curiosity about how nature works. Unlike other children,
    Einstein preferred to think deeply and question everything around him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although he struggled with formal schooling, his imagination and independent thinking
    helped him develop revolutionary ideas that would later change science forever.
    Einstein believed that curiosity and creativity were more important than memorization.
  </p>

  <p>
    He spent much of his life teaching, researching, and writing scientific papers that
    explored space, time, energy, light, and gravity. His work inspired generations
    of scientists around the world.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Scientific Contributions -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>

  <p>
    Einstein made numerous contributions to physics, including the theory of special
    relativity, the theory of general relativity, and the explanation of the photoelectric effect.
    These discoveries reshaped scientific thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    His famous equation E = mc² explains the relationship between mass and energy.
    This simple formula revealed that a small amount of mass can be converted into a
    huge amount of energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Einstein also contributed to quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and cosmology.
    Even today, scientists continue to build upon his ideas to explore the universe.
  </p>

<!-- Personal Life -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Personal Life</h2>

  <p>
    Albert Einstein was known not only for his intelligence but also for his humble personality.
    He lived a simple life and valued peace, humanity, and freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    He spoke openly against war and supported civil rights and human equality.
    Einstein believed that science should be used to improve the lives of people,
    not to destroy humanity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite his global fame, he remained modest and continued to inspire people
    through his words and actions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Legacy -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>

  <p>
    Albert Einstein’s legacy extends far beyond physics. He became a global symbol
    of intelligence, creativity, and peace.
  </p>

  <p>
    His theories are still taught in schools and universities across the world.
    Modern technologies such as GPS, lasers, and nuclear energy rely on principles
    discovered by Einstein.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even decades after his death, Einstein remains one of the most respected
    and admired scientists in human history.
