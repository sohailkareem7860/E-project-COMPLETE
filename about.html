      <!-- BIOGRAPHY -->
      <div>
        <h3>Early Life & Biography</h3>

        <p>
          Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.
          From an early age, he showed deep curiosity about nature,
          mathematics, and the laws governing the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was often misunderstood by teachers because he questioned
          traditional teaching methods. Einstein preferred self-learning
          and independent thinking over memorization.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing his education in Switzerland,
          he struggled to find academic work and took a job
          at the Swiss Patent Office. This period later became
          one of the most productive times of his life.

    <!-- MIRACLE YEAR -->
    <h3>The Miracle Year (1905)</h3>
    <p>
      In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking scientific papers.
      These papers explained the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion,
      special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These discoveries changed physics forever and made Einstein
      one of the most respected scientists in history.
    </p>

    <!-- LATER LIFE -->
    <h3>Later Life</h3>
    <p>
      In the 1930s, due to the rise of Nazism in Germany,
      Einstein moved to the United States.
      He accepted a position at Princeton University,
      where he spent the rest of his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued researching unified field theory
      and actively participated in discussions on philosophy,
      education, and world peace.
    </p>

    <!-- HUMANITARIAN VIEWS -->
    <h3>Humanitarian Views</h3>
