        <div class="card">
          <h4>Post-Graduation Challenges</h4>
          <p class="meta">1900–1902 • Bern, Switzerland</p>
          <p>
            After graduating from ETH Zurich, Einstein faced difficulty finding an academic position. 
            Despite his talent, his unconventional ideas and lack of formal teaching experience made universities reluctant to hire him. 
            He faced financial hardship but remained committed to scientific study.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Swiss Patent Office</h4>
          <p class="meta">1902–1909 • Bern, Switzerland</p>
          <p>
            Einstein secured a job as a technical assistant at the Swiss Patent Office. While seemingly unrelated to physics, this position provided financial stability and allowed him time to study advanced physics independently. 
            He analyzed submitted patent applications critically, which sharpened his analytical thinking and helped him develop his own groundbreaking theories.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>“Miracle Year”</h4>
          <p class="meta">1905 • Bern, Switzerland</p>
          <p>
            While still employed at the Patent Office, Einstein published four landmark papers in the Annalen der Physik journal: 
            special relativity, photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and mass-energy equivalence. 
            These works revolutionized physics and brought him international recognition.

          <h4>First Academic Appointment</h4>
          <p class="meta">1909 • University of Zurich</p>
          <p>
            Einstein finally secured a professorship at the University of Zurich, marking the beginning of his formal academic career. 
            He began teaching, supervising students, and expanding his research. His lectures were known for clarity, innovation, and sometimes challenging traditional thinking.
