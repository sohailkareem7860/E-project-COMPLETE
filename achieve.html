        <h3>Special Theory of Relativity</h3>
        <p class="meta">1905</p>
        <p>
          Einstein formulated the Special Theory of Relativity, introducing the concepts that space and time are relative and that mass and energy are equivalent (E = mc²). 
          This theory transformed physics and laid the foundation for modern cosmology and particle physics.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>General Theory of Relativity</h3>
        <p class="meta">1915</p>
        <p>
          Proposed the General Theory of Relativity, explaining gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. 
          The theory was confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse expedition, making Einstein a global icon.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Nobel Prize in Physics</h3>
        <p class="meta">1921</p>
        <p>
          Awarded for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the quantization of light. 
          This work contributed to the foundation of quantum mechanics and technology such as solar panels and photodetectors.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Quantum Theory Contributions</h3>
        <p class="meta">1905–1925</p>
        <p>
          Contributed significantly to quantum mechanics, including the photoelectric effect, Planck’s radiation law, and the concept of stimulated emission (basis for lasers). 
          His research influenced generations of physicists.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Unified Field Theory Research</h3>
        <p class="meta">1925–1955</p>
        <p>
          Einstein devoted decades attempting to unify gravity and electromagnetism. 
          Although incomplete, his work inspired modern efforts in string theory, quantum gravity, and theoretical physics.

        <h3>Political & Humanitarian Contributions</h3>
        <p class="meta">1914–1955</p>
        <p>
          Advocated for pacifism, Zionism, and civil rights. 
          Co-signed the Einstein–Szilard letter in 1939, alerting the U.S. government about nuclear weapons potential. 
          Supported refugees, science education, and global peace initiatives.
