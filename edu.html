    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Albert Einstein’s educational journey was unconventional, challenging, and full of perseverance. 
      His story shows how curiosity, independent thinking, and self-motivation can surpass traditional schooling.

      <!-- EARLY EDUCATION -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Early Education</h3>
        <p class="meta">1885–1888 • Luitpold Gymnasium, Munich</p>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein started his formal education in Munich at the Luitpold Gymnasium. 
          Even as a young child, he was fascinated by mathematics, physics, and the natural world. 
          However, the rigid and authoritarian school system frustrated him. He found rote memorization boring 
          and preferred to understand the logic behind concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachers often misunderstood his quiet, questioning nature, labeling him as slow or lazy. 
          But Einstein’s independent thought and curiosity were quietly developing during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          A notable anecdote from his early education is that he taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry before the age of 12, 
          simply by reading books and working through problems independently.

      <!-- MOVING TO SWITZERLAND -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Moving to Switzerland</h3>
        <p class="meta">1894–1896 • Cantonal School, Aarau</p>
        <p>
          Einstein’s family moved to Italy, and he eventually followed them to Switzerland. 
          He enrolled in the Cantonal School in Aarau, where the teaching style was more flexible and student-oriented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, Einstein thrived. The focus on understanding, reasoning, and creativity matched his learning style. 
          He excelled in mathematics and physics and began to develop an interest in the philosophical implications of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aarau introduced him to a more open environment where questioning and discussion were encouraged. 
          This experience had a lasting impact, shaping his approach to both learning and life.

      <!-- POLYTECHNIC -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Swiss Federal Polytechnic (ETH Zurich)</h3>
        <p class="meta">1896–1900 • Zurich, Switzerland</p>
        <p>
          In 1896, Einstein enrolled at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic, now known as ETH Zurich. 
          He studied physics and mathematics, aiming for a teaching diploma. 
          Einstein’s passion for learning went beyond the classroom. He often skipped lectures to read, experiment, and think deeply about scientific concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period, he also befriended fellow students and professors who influenced his thinking. 
          He read widely in philosophy and mathematics, exploring the works of Kant, Hume, Mach, and Maxwell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Einstein was talented, his unconventional approach sometimes irritated professors. 
          However, his brilliance in theoretical physics was undeniable, laying the foundation for his later groundbreaking work.

      <!-- PATENT OFFICE -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Self-Education & Patent Office</h3>
        <p class="meta">1900–1905 • Bern, Switzerland</p>
        <p>
          After graduating, Einstein struggled to find an academic position. 
          He accepted a job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. Though it was not academic work, 
          the position gave him a stable income and time to focus on research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Einstein continued his education independently, reading scientific journals, studying classical and modern physics, 
          and formulating original theories. He explored the nature of light, energy, and relativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, he developed several ideas that would culminate in the “Annus Mirabilis” (Miracle Year) of 1905, 
          publishing papers that revolutionized physics, including special relativity and the photoelectric effect.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- DOCTORATE -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Doctorate</h3>
        <p class="meta">1905 • University of Zurich</p>
        <p>
          Einstein earned his PhD in physics with a dissertation titled “A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.” 
          This work combined theoretical reasoning with practical experimentation, demonstrating his ability to bridge abstract theory with real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctorate marked the official beginning of Einstein’s academic recognition, although his unconventional methods and lack of formal academic experience initially made it difficult to gain a university position.

      <!-- LIFELONG LEARNING -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
        <p class="meta">1905–1955 • Throughout Life</p>
        <p>
          Education for Einstein was never confined to formal institutions. He was a lifelong learner, 
          constantly exploring mathematics, physics, philosophy, and humanitarian subjects. 
          He read widely and corresponded with other intellectuals, exchanging ideas and refining his thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Einstein’s educational philosophy emphasized imagination, curiosity, and critical thinking. 
          He valued independent thought and creativity over memorization, believing that true education develops the mind and the ability to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even during his later years at Princeton University, he continued learning, writing, and engaging in intellectual debates, showing that education is a lifelong journey, not a destination.
